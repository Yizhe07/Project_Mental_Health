Project Mental Health

By Jamal Beacham, Jalen Smith and Yizhe Wang


In our project, users can type in all their information, such as name, state, and country and also
add in if they have a history of mental problems and if they suffer from job stress. Once the users
input all their information, they are allowed to grade their mental health on an A-D scale, in
relation to how their job stress is affecting them. A is the highest grade and D is the lowest grade
they can score themselves with. Our project will store all of the information as a new file called save.txt, and users can do some simple analyzation on these data, such as displaying, inserting, deleting, modifying, searching, sorting and counting. 

Our project can record mental health conditions of each person, and should be helpful for making specific treatment plans. Psychologists can be much easier to know whether a worker should take necessary treatment according to the recorded data.
